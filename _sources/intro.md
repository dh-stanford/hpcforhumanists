# HPC for Humanists (and Social Scientists)

If someone has told you to use HPC but references to SLURM or nodes or or parallelization leave you feeling baffled and overwhelmed, you're in the right place! *HPC for Humanists (and Social Scientists)* is a practical guide to getting started with high-performance computing for people with some basic familiarity with the command line and working with code, but not much more than that. 

If you're looking for more background first, check out the Programming Historian tutorial on the [command line](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash). Examples here will mostly involve working with text using Python, so you might want to [review Python text manipulation basics](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/working-with-text-files) too.

Most of this guide has been written as a big-picture explainer for HPC that isn't tied to the peculiarities of any one institution's cluster, because the details vary. There are also more detailed, step-by-step instructions specific to Stanford. The titles of those sections start off with an evergreen tree emoji ðŸŒ².
